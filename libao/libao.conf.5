.SH NAME
libao.conf \- configuration for libao.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B /etc/libao.conf

.B ~/.libao

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B libao.conf
and
.B .libao
are configuration files for libao, the audio output library.  They
specify various options to libao, as described below.
.B libao.conf
sets system-wide options, whereas
.B ~/.libao
sets user-specific options.  When an option is set in 
both places, the option in
.B ~/.libao
takes precedence.

.SH FILE FORMAT
The file consists of comments and key-value pairs.  Comments are on separate lines that start with a
.B #
symbol.  The key-value pairs are of the form:
.RS
.BR
.B key=value
.RE
where
.B key
contains no whitespace and no equal signs.
.B value
will be all of the text after the equal sign until (but not including)
the ending newline.  Beware of extra spaces at the end of the line!
They will probably be interpreted as part of the option value.

Valid option keys are:
.RS
.IP default_driver
The short name of the driver libao should use by default.  Valid values
include (not all are available on every platform): oss, esd, arts, alsa,
alsa05, nas, irix, and sun.  Note that "sun" is used on many BSD
systems as well as Solaris.  The "alsa" driver is for the 0.9.x ALSA API,
whereas the "alsa05" driver is for the 0.5.x API.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLE

Here is an example
.B libao.conf
that forces the OSS driver to be used by default:

    # This is a comment.
    default_driver=oss

.SH BUGS

.B libao.conf
is missing a number of potentially useful options.
